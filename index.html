                <h2>missile man of india</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an

                    2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
                    original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

                <h3>Biographies</h3>
                <p>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple
                    city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local
                    mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one
                    sister in his family, from which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and
                    landowners and had vast land and property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims
                    and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's
                    family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell
                    newspapers to supplement his family income. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam#:~:text=Avul%20Pakir%20Jainulabdeen%20Abdul%20Kalam,studied%20physics%20and%20aerospace%20engineering." class="link">Read More</a> </p>
